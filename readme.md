# lazymail 
focus on something that matters.

  [support me](https://buymeacoffee.com/zayeed), this is a passion project fueled only by my love of programming without any consistent monetization policy (e.g: ads or other nasty stuff), so any donations are very much appreciated.

## What's Lazymail?
Lazymail is a website that lets you quickly generate email by only providing a short summary.

## Planned Features
|name |status  |
|--|--|
| style of writing (formal, semi-formal, informal) | planned |

## How can I contribute?
Skim through the issues, open one, fix  a bug, open a PR. Everything is appreciated.

## Development Schedule
This is just a passion project, so I can't give any solid schedule I'll stick by (mostly because of me procrastinating and my lack of motivation)
